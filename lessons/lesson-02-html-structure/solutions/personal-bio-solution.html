        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p class="intro-paragraph">
            Welcome to my personal webpage! I'm Alex Johnson, a passionate computer science student 
            with a keen interest in web development and user experience design. I believe that 
            technology has the power to solve real-world problems and create meaningful connections 
            between people.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, I spend my time learning 
            new programming languages, working on personal projects, and contributing to open-source 
            initiatives. When I'm not coding, you can find me hiking, reading science fiction novels, 
            or experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen.

        <h2>Hobbies & Interests</h2>
        
        <h3>Technology & Programming</h3>
        <p>
            I'm passionate about emerging technologies and enjoy experimenting with new programming 
            frameworks and languages. Currently exploring React, Node.js, and Python for 
            machine learning applications.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Outdoor Activities</h3>
        <p>
            Nature provides the perfect balance to screen time. I love hiking local trails, 
            camping under the stars, and photography. Some of my favorite shots are landscape 
            photos from recent camping trips to national parks.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Creative Pursuits</h3>
        <p>
            Creativity fuels innovation. I enjoy digital design, sketching user interface mockups, 
            and playing guitar. Music helps me think through complex programming challenges and 
            provides inspiration for creative problem-solving.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Reading & Learning</h3>
        <p>
            Continuous learning is essential in technology. I regularly read tech blogs, 
            science fiction novels, and biographies of innovators. Currently reading 
            <cite>"The Pragmatic Programmer"</cite> and <cite>"Dune"</cite> by Frank Herbert.

        <h2>Career Aspirations</h2>
        
        <p>
            My goal is to become a full-stack web developer specializing in creating accessible, 
            user-friendly applications that make a positive impact on people's lives. I'm particularly 
            interested in working on educational technology or healthcare applications.
