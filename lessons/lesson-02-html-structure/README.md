# Lesson 2: HTML Structure

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Understand the basic structure of an HTML document
- Identify and use essential HTML tags and attributes
- Create properly structured HTML documents with headings and paragraphs
- Validate HTML code and follow semantic markup principles
- Organize content hierarchically using appropriate heading levels

## Key Concepts

### 1. HTML Document Structure
- **DOCTYPE declaration**: Tells the browser which version of HTML to expect
- **html element**: Root element that contains all other elements
- **head section**: Contains metadata, links to stylesheets, and page information
- **body section**: Contains the visible content of the webpage

### 2. Essential HTML Tags

#### Basic Structure Tags
- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: HTML5 document type declaration
- `<html>`: Root element with lang attribute for accessibility
- `<head>`: Document metadata container
- `<title>`: Page title shown in browser tab
- `<body>`: Main content container

#### Content Tags
- `<h1>` to `<h6>`: Heading hierarchy (h1 is most important)
- `<p>`: Paragraph text
- `<br>`: Line break (self-closing)
- `<hr>`: Horizontal rule/separator (self-closing)

### 3. HTML Attributes
- **Global attributes**: Can be used on any element
  - `id`: Unique identifier for an element
  - `class`: Assigns CSS classes for styling
  - `title`: Tooltip text on hover
  - `lang`: Language of the element's content
- **Element-specific attributes**: Unique to certain tags

### 4. Semantic HTML Principles
- Use tags that describe content meaning, not appearance
- Proper heading hierarchy for document outline
- Meaningful element selection for accessibility
- Consistent indentation and formatting

### 5. HTML Validation
- W3C Markup Validator for checking code quality
- Browser developer tools for debugging
- Common validation errors and how to fix them

## Practical Exercise: Personal Bio Page

### Project Description
Create a well-structured personal biography webpage using proper HTML structure, semantic headings, and organized content sections.

### Tasks
1. **Create Basic HTML Structure**
   - Set up a complete HTML5 document with proper DOCTYPE
   - Include appropriate meta tags in the head section
   - Add a descriptive page title

2. **Content Organization**
   - Create a main heading with your name
   - Add subheadings for different sections (About, Education, Interests, etc.)
   - Write paragraph content for each section
   - Use proper heading hierarchy (h1, h2, h3)

3. **Apply HTML Best Practices**
   - Use semantic markup appropriately
   - Add id and class attributes where relevant
   - Include proper indentation and comments
   - Ensure code validation

4. **Content Sections to Include**
   - Personal introduction paragraph
   - Educational background
   - Hobbies and interests
   - Career goals or aspirations
   - Contact information (placeholder)

### Deliverables
- Complete HTML file with personal biography
- Properly structured document with heading hierarchy
- Valid HTML code (tested with W3C validator)
- Clean, readable code with appropriate comments

## Self-Assessment Questions
1. What is the purpose of the DOCTYPE declaration in HTML?
2. Explain the difference between the `<head>` and `<body>` sections
3. Why is proper heading hierarchy important for accessibility?
4. What are global attributes and name three examples?
5. How would you structure a document with a main title, two major sections, and subsections within each?

## Next Lesson Preview
In Lesson 3, we'll expand our HTML knowledge by learning about links, lists, images, and multimedia elements to create more interactive and engaging web pages.
