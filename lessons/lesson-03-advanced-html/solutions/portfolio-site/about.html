        <p>
            My journey into web development began during my college years when I created my first 
            website for a local nonprofit organization. What started as a simple volunteer project 
            quickly became a passion that would shape my entire career path.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            After graduating with a degree in Computer Science, I dove headfirst into the world of 
            full-stack development. I've had the privilege of working with startups, established 
            companies, and freelance clients, each experience teaching me something new about 
            technology, user experience, and the power of well-crafted code.
        </p>
        
        <h3>What Drives Me</h3>
        <p>
            I'm motivated by the endless possibilities that code creates. Every project is a puzzle 
            to solve, a user experience to improve, or a business problem to address through technology. 
            I believe that great software isn't just functionalâ€”it's intuitive, accessible, and 
            makes people's lives a little bit easier.

        <h3>Hobbies & Interests</h3>
        
        <h4>Outdoor Adventures</h4>
        <p>
            When I need a break from screens, I love exploring the great outdoors. Hiking local 
            trails helps me clear my mind and often leads to creative solutions for coding challenges. 
            My favorite spots include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Blue Ridge Parkway - Perfect for weekend camping trips</li>
            <li>Local state parks - Great for evening walks and photography</li>
            <li>Urban greenways - Convenient for quick nature breaks during the workday</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Culinary Experiments</h4>
        <p>
            Cooking is my other creative outlet. I love experimenting with new recipes and 
            techniques, especially dishes from different cultures. There's something satisfying 
            about following a recipe (like following code documentation) and then improvising 
            to make it your own.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Community Involvement</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Volunteer coding instructor at local community center</li>
            <li>Organizer for Women in Tech meetup group</li>
            <li>Mentor through Code for Good nonprofit initiative</li>
            <li>Regular participant in local hackathons and tech events</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Reading & Learning</h4>
        <p>Current reading list includes:</p>
