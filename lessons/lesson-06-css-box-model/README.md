# Lesson 6: CSS Box Model & Positioning

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Understand the CSS Box Model and its components (margin, border, padding, content)
- Apply different box-sizing models and understand their implications
- Master CSS positioning techniques (static, relative, absolute, fixed, sticky)
- Control element dimensions, spacing, and layout positioning
- Create layered layouts using z-index and positioning context
- Debug layout issues using browser developer tools
- Implement practical layout patterns using positioning

## Key Concepts

### 1. The CSS Box Model
- **Content area**: Where text and images appear
- **Padding**: Space between content and border (inside the element)
- **Border**: Edge around the padding and content
- **Margin**: Space outside the border (between elements)
- **Box-sizing**: Controls how width and height are calculated
- **Visual representation**: Every element is a rectangular box

### 2. Box-Sizing Property
- **content-box** (default): Width/height applies only to content
- **border-box**: Width/height includes padding and border
- **Best practice**: Use border-box for more predictable sizing

### 3. Margin and Padding
- **Individual sides**: top, right, bottom, left
- **Shorthand syntax**: 1, 2, 3, or 4 values
- **Margin collapse**: Vertical margins between elements collapse
- **Auto margins**: Centering elements horizontally
- **Negative margins**: Creating overlapping effects

### 4. Borders
- **Border properties**: width, style, color
- **Individual borders**: border-top, border-right, etc.
- **Border-radius**: Creating rounded corners
- **Border styles**: solid, dashed, dotted, etc.

### 5. CSS Positioning
- **Static**: Default flow positioning
- **Relative**: Positioned relative to normal position
- **Absolute**: Positioned relative to nearest positioned ancestor
- **Fixed**: Positioned relative to viewport
- **Sticky**: Hybrid between relative and fixed
- **Position offsets**: top, right, bottom, left

### 6. Stacking Context and Z-Index
- **Stacking order**: How elements layer on top of each other
- **Z-index property**: Controls stacking order
- **Stacking context**: When new stacking contexts are created
- **Best practices**: Managing z-index values systematically

## Practical Exercise: Interactive Dashboard Layout

### Project Description
Create an interactive dashboard layout that demonstrates mastery of the box model, positioning, and layered design. The dashboard will include a header, sidebar, main content area, and floating elements.

### Tasks
1. **Box Model Mastery**
   - Create components using proper padding, margins, and borders
   - Implement both content-box and border-box sizing
   - Use box-shadow for depth and visual hierarchy
   - Apply border-radius for modern design aesthetics

2. **Layout Structure**
   - Build a fixed header that stays at the top during scrolling
   - Create a sidebar with navigation that can be toggled
   - Design a main content area that adjusts to sidebar visibility
   - Implement a sticky footer that stays at the bottom

3. **Positioning Techniques**
   - Use absolute positioning for overlay elements
   - Implement relative positioning for component adjustments
   - Create fixed notification badges and floating action buttons
   - Add sticky elements like a "back to top" button

4. **Interactive Elements**
   - Design modal dialogs using positioned overlays
   - Create dropdown menus with proper z-index stacking
   - Implement tooltip components positioned relative to triggers
   - Build a mobile-responsive collapsible navigation

5. **Advanced Box Model Features**
   - Use CSS transforms for positioning adjustments
   - Implement box-shadow for depth and focus states
   - Create card-based layouts with consistent spacing
   - Apply overflow properties for content management

### Deliverables
- Fully functional dashboard layout with multiple positioning examples
- Responsive design that works on various screen sizes
- Interactive elements demonstrating z-index and stacking contexts
- Well-organized CSS with clear comments explaining positioning choices
- Documentation of box model decisions and their visual impact
