## Key Concepts

### 1. CSS Flexbox (Flexible Box Layout)
- **Flex container**: Parent element with display: flex
- **Flex items**: Direct children of flex container
- **Main axis vs Cross axis**: Understanding flex direction
- **Flex properties**: flex-grow, flex-shrink, flex-basis, flex shorthand

### 2. CSS Grid Layout
- **Grid container**: Parent element with display: grid
- **Grid items**: Direct children of grid container

### 5. Responsive Grid & Flex Patterns
- **Auto-fit vs auto-fill**: Responsive grid columns
- **Flex-wrap**: Responsive flex layouts
- **Container queries**: Future of responsive design
- **Intrinsic web design**: Content-based responsive layouts

## Practical Exercise: Modern Web Application Layout

### Project Description
Create a complete web application interface using both CSS Grid and Flexbox, demonstrating when and how to use each layout method effectively.

### Tasks
1. **Page Structure with CSS Grid**
   - Create main application layout (header, sidebar, main, footer)
   - Implement responsive grid areas that adapt to screen size
   - Use grid-template-areas for semantic layout definition
   - Handle grid gap and spacing consistently

2. **Component Layouts with Flexbox**
   - Build navigation components with flexible spacing
   - Create card-based content layouts with equal heights
   - Implement form layouts with proper alignment
   - Design button groups and action bars

3. **Responsive Design Patterns**
   - Create auto-responsive card grids using Grid
   - Implement flexible navigation that collapses on mobile
   - Build sidebar layouts that stack on smaller screens
   - Use container queries where supported

4. **Advanced Layout Techniques**
   - Combine Grid and Flexbox for optimal solutions
   - Create overlapping content using Grid
   - Implement masonry-style layouts
   - Build complex dashboard interfaces

5. **Performance and Best Practices**
   - Optimize layout performance with efficient CSS
   - Use subgrid where appropriate and supported
   - Implement fallbacks for older browsers
   - Test layouts across different screen sizes and devices

### Deliverables
- Complete web application interface using modern layout methods
- Responsive design that works from mobile to desktop
- Documentation explaining layout method choices
- Performance-optimized CSS with clear organization
