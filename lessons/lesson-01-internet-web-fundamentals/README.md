# Lesson 1: Internet and Web Fundamentals

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Understand the history and evolution of the Internet and World Wide Web
- Explain the relationship between the Internet and the Web
- Describe how DNS, HTTP, and TCP/IP protocols work
- Differentiate between websites, web pages, and web applications
- Set up a local development environment
- Use browser developer tools effectively

## Key Concepts

### 1. History of the Internet
- ARPANET origins (1969)
- Evolution to modern Internet infrastructure
- Key milestones and technological advances

### 2. Internet vs. World Wide Web
- **Internet**: Global network of interconnected computers
- **World Wide Web**: Information system built on top of the Internet
- Tim Berners-Lee and CERN (1989-1991)

### 3. Core Protocols
- **TCP/IP**: Foundation protocol suite for Internet communication
- **HTTP/HTTPS**: HyperText Transfer Protocol for web communication
- **DNS**: Domain Name System - translating domain names to IP addresses

### 4. Web Architecture Components
- **Web Servers**: Host and serve web content
- **Web Browsers**: Client applications that render web content
- **Web Pages**: Individual documents written in HTML
- **Websites**: Collections of related web pages
- **Web Applications**: Interactive programs running in browsers

### 5. How the Web Works
1. User enters URL in browser
2. DNS lookup converts domain to IP address
3. Browser sends HTTP request to server
4. Server processes request and sends response
5. Browser renders the received content

## Practical Exercise: Setting Up Your Web Development Environment

### Project Description
Set up a complete local web development environment and create your first web server to understand how web content is served and accessed.

### Tasks
1. **Install a Code Editor**
   - Download and install Visual Studio Code
   - Install essential extensions (Live Server, HTML CSS Support)

2. **Create a Simple Web Server**
   - Set up a basic HTTP server using Python or Node.js
   - Serve a simple HTML file
   - Access it through different browsers

3. **Explore Browser Developer Tools**
   - Inspect network requests
   - View page source vs. DOM
   - Monitor console messages
   - Analyze page load performance

4. **DNS and Network Analysis**
   - Use command-line tools (ping, nslookup, traceroute)
   - Analyze HTTP headers
   - Understand request/response cycle

### Deliverables
- Screenshot of your local server running
- Simple HTML page served from your local server
- Network analysis report showing HTTP requests
- Summary document explaining what you learned
