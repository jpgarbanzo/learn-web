# Lesson 7: Advanced CSS & Responsive Design

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Master advanced CSS selectors and pseudo-classes/pseudo-elements
- Create responsive layouts using media queries and flexible units
- Implement CSS animations and transitions for enhanced user experience
- Use CSS custom properties (variables) for maintainable stylesheets
- Apply modern CSS features like clamp(), min(), max(), and calc()
- Build mobile-first responsive designs that work across all devices
- Optimize CSS for performance and maintainability

## Key Concepts

### 1. Advanced Selectors & Pseudo-classes
- **Structural pseudo-classes**: :nth-child(), :nth-of-type(), :first-child, :last-child
- **UI state pseudo-classes**: :hover, :focus, :active, :disabled, :checked
- **Form pseudo-classes**: :valid, :invalid, :required, :optional
- **Logical pseudo-classes**: :not(), :is(), :where()

### 2. CSS Custom Properties (Variables)
- **Declaration**: --variable-name: value
- **Usage**: var(--variable-name, fallback)
- **Scope**: Global (:root) vs local scope
- **Dynamic updates**: Changing variables with JavaScript

### 3. Responsive Design Principles
- **Mobile-first approach**: Start with mobile, enhance for larger screens
- **Flexible units**: rem, em, vw, vh, %, fr
- **Fluid typography**: Using clamp() for scalable text
- **Flexible images**: max-width: 100%, object-fit

### 4. Media Queries
- **Breakpoints**: Common screen size breakpoints
- **Media types**: screen, print, speech
- **Media features**: width, height, orientation, resolution
- **Logical operators**: and, or, not

### 5. CSS Animations & Transitions
- **Transitions**: Smooth property changes over time
- **Keyframe animations**: Complex multi-step animations
- **Animation properties**: duration, timing-function, delay, iteration
- **Performance**: Using transform and opacity for smooth animations

### 6. Modern CSS Functions
- **calc()**: Mathematical calculations in CSS
- **min(), max(), clamp()**: Responsive sizing with constraints
- **Custom properties with functions**: Dynamic calculations

## Practical Exercise: Responsive Portfolio Website

### Project Description
Transform a static portfolio into a fully responsive, modern website using advanced CSS techniques, animations, and mobile-first design principles.

### Tasks
1. **Responsive Layout Design**
   - Implement mobile-first responsive design methodology
   - Create fluid layouts that adapt to any screen size
   - Use CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsive components
   - Implement responsive typography using clamp() and fluid units

2. **Advanced Styling Techniques**
   - Set up CSS custom properties for consistent theming
   - Use advanced selectors for complex styling scenarios
   - Implement hover effects and micro-interactions
   - Create focus states for accessibility

3. **Animation & Interactivity**
   - Add smooth transitions for user interface elements
   - Create loading animations and scroll-triggered effects
   - Implement CSS-only interactive components
   - Use animations to enhance user experience without overuse

4. **Media Query Implementation**
   - Design for multiple breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop, large screens)
   - Create print-friendly styles using print media queries
   - Implement dark mode using prefers-color-scheme
   - Handle orientation changes and high-density displays

5. **Performance Optimization**
   - Organize CSS for optimal loading and maintainability
   - Use efficient selectors and avoid CSS bloat
   - Implement critical CSS concepts for faster page loads
   - Test performance across different devices and connections

### Deliverables
- Fully responsive portfolio website working on all screen sizes
- Smooth animations and transitions enhancing user experience
- CSS custom properties system for consistent theming
- Comprehensive media query strategy covering all devices
- Performance-optimized CSS with clear organization
